Cpp compilation
================

Prepeare data according to a predefined format. 
generate new_data.cpp: (using snippet of code mailed to me)
	Declare the NO_DATA declarative. 
	dat.load_file_gianni("data_file_name")

throw the data.cpp to the source code folder.

compile the code with mex (see snippet)
This results Gomouko_bfs.mexa64

Execution
=========

Create a directory and put there:
	the matlab code for mcs Gomouko_optim_mcs.m
         wrapper: Gomouko_wrapper.m 
         job script Gomouko.sh  and getbest.sh x0.mat init0.m , times.txt

Change the code to start with NULL (instead of times.txt) 
compile again.


In the job script -t mapps to PBS_ARRAYID

submit the job. 

Inside the working directory creates a directory per each subject. 
inside there's output

	position(index), iterations, loglikelihood(est.),  #trails per position, loglikelihood_total, how_many_more_positions_for_subject. 
when last field goes to 0 that's the end of the calculation and the final total loglik is shown. 

Then it proceeds to the next parameter vector.
  
Getting the results
===================
Inside the subject folder
mcsresult.mat
